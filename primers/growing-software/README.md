# A Young Coder's Primer on Growing Software

This primer serves as a guide to software coders on the Art of Growing Software. Software programs and systems are organic creatures. They might not be conscious and they may not be like us carbon-based lifeforms. But in many ways, they grow, evolve, and break down in similar ways as us. Their structure and evoluation can be intelligently guided over time as we aim to provide our users with more and more valuable experiences. 

This primer covers concepts like:
- The Stages of Software Growth (from a single-cell organism to complex creatures with organs and tissues)
- Entropy Reigns (even in the software world, entropy impacts us just like the physical world; more dependencies often introduce more sources of entropy into our software resulting in even more rapid "software rot" when energy is not expended in keeping the software runnable)
- Evolution Markers: Clues that help you know when your software might be ready for its next stage of growth
- TASTAAFL (There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch): Nothing comes free; every software design decision involves trade-offs
- There Is No Single Right Answer
- The Law of Complexity: You can't escape complexity; it will always find you

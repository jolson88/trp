# A Young Coder's Primer on Testing Software

This primer serves as a guide to software coders on the Art of Testing Software. TODO

Testing software involves writing code that verifies the behavior of your sofware. As we are still writing software, the same principles from [A Young Coder's Primer on Growing Software]("../growing-software.md") apply while testing our software.

This primer covers concepts like:
- Our Testing Safety Net (the value of automated software tests)
- Principles of our Test Net (guiding our testing principles by accepting the constraints and realities of software)
- Techniques for Test Net Making (software architecture patterns, logic patterns, service patterns)

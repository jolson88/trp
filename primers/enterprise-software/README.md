# A Software Engineer's Primer on Enterprise Software

This primer serves as a guide to practicing software engineers on the art developing software for a company selling a product or service. TODO

This primer covers concepts like:

- The Tradeoff Between Speed and Quality
- Creating Flexible Software That Lasts (e.g. fighting entropy through testing, but not over-testing or making your software calcified and hard)

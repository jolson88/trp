- 📄 Users can explore the different tags and see each post associated with a tag
- 📙 Each tag can have an associated description that is shown on it's tag index page
- 🎯 Users and I can see the current plan for features on the site, including all previously released features

- 🔍 Users can search the blog via a simple search box on the site
    - Probably just redirecting to DuckDuckGo?
- 🛠 I can create new tools (static mini-pages) for my own use on the site
    - Example: A pomodoro timer (with built-in task tracking)
    - Example: A mind-mapping tool (uses local storage and import/export support)

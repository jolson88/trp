      Sometimes it feels like the memories are long gone. Sometimes not. But I always wish I had the
      solid memories that many of my colleagues over the years have had.

    You see, I have a horrible memory. I know I'll forget this code. I know I'll need to be able to
    get back up to speed with it quickly. As I'm making my own improvements, I need to know that I
    haven't broken anything. My only guarantee is that I <em>will</em> forgot the details and
    nuances of the code by the next time I work on it.

- Morning: meetings, meetings, meetings.
- Kicked off [[TypeScript Engineering Specialty]] group (now known as The Script Kitties).
	- Glad I did the "group-driven" brainstorming to build out ideas for it together. I'm really excited about the options people came up with and how much cool stuff there is for us in the future!
- Good burndown progress. Ended up finishing first pass of catalog tests (def failures). Included test fixes while I was at it and could fix "deeper" test fixture issues:
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8490
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8488
- Reviewed/approved PRs for team members
	- Was STOKED to see Aaron make a PR to the new `alarms` command :D. https://github.com/OpenSesame/marketplace-runner/pull/3
- OSQ catch-up
- Paired with Ellis on testing of their work
	- Ellis had me take a look at what they did to finally get it to work.
	- Funny thing, we discovered while poking around that the repository Ellis was stubbing was something we already made into a Nullable. So Ellis was able to easily change over to using the Nullable directly and adding one more piece to the Nullable :D
- Tried to get my behats running locally in headed mode so I could better see what's going on. No luck yet, but still have some ideas to try.

## Takeaways on the [[Zettelkasten method]]

- ### A thinking and creativity tool at its core
	- A key part of generating insights is in the connecting of different ideas together. This method encourages this process to happen as much as possible.
		- References
			- **Writing down the most salient and captivating ideas while reading forces you to reframe the ideas into your own language and thinking**. Ideas are transformed and start becoming your own from the moment they are written down. ([[How to take smart notes]], p73)
	- Critical thinking is a core thinking and creativity tool needed to learn effectively. Taking smart notes provides us with deliberate practice in developing these skills.
		- References
			- **Taking smart notes is the deliberate practice of developing critical thinking and writing skills**. Reading or writing alone doesn't cut it. ([[How to take smart notes]], p84)
		
- ### Builds a virtuous cycle of insight generation through daily habits
	- This provides a critical mass in which our daily habits themselves help us to generate more insights in a virtuous cycle and improves in power over time.

- ### Reduces need for willpower and embraces ego-depletion
	- Reducing the number of decisions we make gives us the space to **focus on the decisions that matter and are the most impactful**. Decision-making is known to cost willpower. A surprising number of decisions and tasks lead to this. Adopting the Zettelkasten method allows us to eliminate nearly all organizational decisions since most of the decisions are made for us by the system.
		- "By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced" ([[How to take smart notes]])

## Tips and tricks for taking better notes

- **Always read with an eye towards connections in your Zettelkasten**. The aim is to *capture the ideas behind what's written on the page*. ([[How to take smart notes]], p75)
- **The goal of reading is to have a "meaningful dialog" with the text**. It is *not* about copying. Copying can be inaccurate or downright harmful as most of the original context is lost and the words could be interpreted differently when read within a slightly different context (e.g. your own writing). ([[How to take smart notes]], p75)

## Notes

### Existing note-taking systems don't work

- The "typical" folder-based or topic-based note taking systems tend to leave us with a sea of notes across many different places. Writing then becomes a process of heavily relying on our brain to remember where all our notes are, how they might be connected, what the potential narratives are, etc. Or, we might create even more notes point to our other notes and only end up making the problem worse.
	- We are constantly faced with the question "Under which topic do I store this information?" In which context might I come across this information again? Or, "What book was this from?" "What class was I in?" For a writer or knowledge worker, it makes "as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can't find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store" (How To Take Smart Notes, Ahrens, 2nd edition)
- A good, structured workflow **relieves us from remembering** and keeping track of everything. If we can trust the system, we can *let go of keeping everything in our head* and can focus on what is important: the content, the argument, and the ideas.
	- Having a structure to *work within* is different than making *execution plans* about something. To follow through with a plan, you need to use willpower.
	- A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975).
	- "I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else." - Niklas Luhmann
- Most important indicator of academic success is not IQ, it's how much self-discipline or self-control used to approach tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004). But willpower appears to be a limited resource that depletes quickly and doesn't improve much over the long-term (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmiechel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006)
- So to best set yourself up for success, it's not about using willpower, **it's about not having to use willpower in the first place**. Having a *meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower* every time. Self-control and self-discipline have more to do with environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2). You don't need willpower to to avoid eating a chocolate bar if there's no chocolate bars around in the first place.
- A powerful external system to think in that is fertile for fostering new connections can be **more impactful than any amount of IQ or willpower**. Studies of highly successful people have showed that success is result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place, not from strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). Even hard work becomes almost effortless if is *aligned with our interest, motivation, and work*.
- "The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones - and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort." (How To Take Smart Notes, 2nd edition, Ahrens)
	
### The Zettelkasten method

- **The primary goal:** The Zettelkasten method is a personal knowledge management system that aims to efficiently turn thoughts and discoveries into a treasure of smart and interconnected notes. This improves our ability to generate even more new ideas. Ultimately, the [[Zettelkasten method]] is a tool for thinking.
- Biggest advantage compared to top-down systems is that the Zettelkasten becomes more valuable the larger it grows, instead of getting more unwieldy and confusing. The Zettelkasten does not face this same trade-off of too few or too many ideas.
	- "The Zettelkasten is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering." (How To Take Smart Notes, Ahrens, 2nd edition) #quote #learning #efficiency
- For the Zettelkasten method to achieve its potential though, we not only need to be aware of the number of our notes as well as their quality and how we handle them. This is not just about deciding what to capture, but it's equally important to realize what can be discarded. Pruning is a vital part of learning.
- To keep focused on thinking and learning, we need to distinguish between three types of notes:
	- **Fleeting notes**. Fleeting notes capture ideas quickly while we are busy working on other things. Fleeting notes are only useful if they are reviewed within a day or two and are turned into permanent notes. If you already know you likely won't act on this thought in the next 1-2 days, don't take the note in the first place.
	- **Permanent notes**. Permanent notes provide your permanent reservoir of ideas you will ultimately build off of. These are typically in the form of reference/literature notes, and Zettelkasten notes. They should capture exactly one idea and should be written as if they will be read by somebody else. They should be standalone: full sentences, disclose sources, make references, and strive for concision and clarity.
		- Represent **the actual core thought or idea in written form**! Your permanent notes are longer reminders, or thoughts about ideas, or vague recollections. They are the idea.
	- **Project notes**. Notes only relevant to a specific project. They might represent comments or corrections made to articles or books, deadlines, or other notes that can be discarded after the project is finished. They exist solely to deliver the final project.
- The Zettelkasten method **helps break learning up into discrete and well-defined steps**, but ones that are still interconnected and help foster the development of new connections between ideas. We might be taking a fleshed out idea and just doing a "final edit of the first draft." Or you might be the person that has a list of ideas and evidence and just need to craft it into a rough first draft. Or you might be the research helping discover new information and ideas to build upon.
	- Consume media and turn into notes
	- Assemble notes
	- Bring them into order
	- Turn notes into draft
	- Review edit draft into publication
	
### Common mistakes of new users

- **Keeping too many notes or information around**. Pruning is an important part of learning. Not only does it give us more headspace to thinking of more ideas, but it also helps raise the signal-to-noise ratio within our Zettelkasten.
  id:: 657b8c95-a07f-44ab-ad12-af9ee95fcf62
	- "The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project, or actually not that good at second glance." (How To Take Smart Notes, 2nd edition, Ahrens)
- **Collecting notes only related to certain projects.** Our Zettelkasten exists to help us build up larger and larger ideas instead of restricting ourselves to our own memory capacity or our most recent project. These need to be permanent notes that we have rebuilt into our own ideas and serve as a framework to discover new ideas.
- **Treating all notes as fleeting notes**. This can be noticed most by the behavior of a growing piles of material followed by the impulse for major cleanups. Just collecting unprocessed thoughts ends up leading to chaos. It is the processing and thinking that brings value to our notes.

### Why aren't more people using this?

- More focus on slip-box nature instead of the workflow its embedded within.
- Most information published about it was only in German (and only within a small subset of people interested in Luhmann's work)
- The system is super simple. People underestimate the power of simplicity.

### Thinking is the entire point

- We are aiming to generate new ideas. Writing is a means to an end. Notes are just the tangible outcome of the process. While writing notes accompanies the main work, when done right, it also greatly benefits our thinking abilities later. Translating something into our own words and concepts is an important aspect of memory retention and recall.

	- "Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier, they make it possible... no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding" (Levy, 2011, 270, Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics) #quote #learning #writing
- The purpose is not to collect ideas, but to **further develop** the ones we have and **form new interconnected ones**. Does this new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what is already there? Can the ideas be combined into something new? What new questions are raised?
- **But how do you plan for insight which can't be anticipated** by definition? Aim to structure workflow where insight and new ideas become the driving forces that push us forward. Learning is structured in a way that encourages insights is accumulative and helps spark even more new ideas.
  id:: 657a5ac6-d8f7-40e5-a852-a8e1f4f60b86
- By focusing on our own interests, **ideas, questions, and arguments will start appearing with little to no effort**. Every question from our Zettelkasten comes with its own research material, or we can observe where clusters of notes have built up indicating a rich area for more exploration.
- A Zettelkasten **helps us navigate different contexts and more easily identify how new information can be integrated**. Each note we file, or each connected set of notes that we review, we are *constantly giving ourselves an opportunity to notice new connections between concepts*. This in turn helps us form even more insights.
- A Zettelkasten is **part dialog partner, idea generator, and productivity engine all rolled into one**. A single note is only as valuable as its context, which isn't necessarily the same context it was originally taken from. One idea or note can contribute to many different contexts.

### A simple guide to writing a paper

1. Make fleeting notes
2. Make literature notes
3. Make permanent notes
4. File new permanent notes into your Zettelkasten
	- File into behind one or more related notes. Look to which note the new one directly relates to, or if it isn't related, just file it behind last one
	- Add links to related notes
	- Be able to find it later by linking directly from index, or linking it to a topic linked directly to index
5. Develop topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within the system
	- Read more to challenge, strength, change, and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. You don't need to brainstorm a topic as the Zettelkasten will help guide you into chains of notes and clusters that your own interests have discovered.
6. After a while, enough ideas will develop to form a topic to write about
7. Turn your notes into a rough draft
8. Edit and proofread your manuscript.

## The Zettelkasten method's four principles

- ### Writing is what matters
	- "One cannot think without writing" - Niklas Luhmann 
	- **Writing is not just a tool for communication, it's also a tool for thinking**. Writing is the medium in which research, learning, studying, and communicating all take place. 
		- "If I want something, it's more time. The only thing that really is a nuisance is the lack of time." - Niklas Luhmann (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek, 1987, 139)
		- Everybody writes, but very few give guidance for every-day note that comprises the largest type of writing we do. But the vast number of resources dedicated to the writing process target the exceptional moments where long-form writing constitutes the end goal.
		- Good productive writing is also based on good note-taking. So what can we do differently to be better prepared in using our notes? The book "How to take smart notes" hopes to address this shortcoming and talk about advice in taking notes that help inform all our thinking processes.
	- **Focusing on writing makes learning efficient and focused**. We don't have to focus so much on what we "should" learn. By intentionally looking for core ideas and evidence that you find interesting and you want to capture for later, you learn in a more engaged way. Even if we decide to never write a single line of a larger work, this style of thinking and note taking will also improve our reading, thinking, and other intellectual skills as well.
		- References
			- Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008)
- ### Simplicity is paramount
	- **The system itself should be simple**. We are surrounded by lots of information, and we will be collecting ever-increasing numbers of thoughts and connections between those thoughts. Our body of content will be ever-increasing in complexity itself. So the underlying system should be simple to stay out of the way.
		- To help manage complexity, keep things as simple as possible when possible and keep focussed on a small number of principles. The system's simplicity will allow us to build up complexity where it belongs: in the content itself. (See cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015 for an overview).
	- **The threshold for capturing a new idea must be as low as possible**. Most ideas will not stand the test of time. Other ideas will be the seed for a major product, or the seed of a seed of a project. There's no way to foresee which will be which.
	- **We can easily combine, restructure, and reorder all notes in different ways** because they all go into a single container, and all in a standardized format. The Zettelkasten is like the *shipping container of the knowledge worker world*: the entire pipeline is streamlined towards one goal: **generating insights** (as opposed to "delivering goods").
- ### Nobody ever starts from scratch
	- We are not guided by our own plans dreamed up by your own unreliable brains. We are guided by interest, curiosity, and intuition which is built through reading, thinking, discussing, writing, and developing ideas. This process continuously grows, and reflects our growing knowledge of the world around us.
	- When we start an intellectual task, we need to find a good question or idea to write about. To find a good question or idea to write about, we need to have already thought about a topic... To decide and think about a topic, we need to have read or watched quite a bit about more than just one topic... The decision to consume one thing over another thing is itself based on personal preferences and desires that don't materialize out of thin air either.
	- Every intellectual task starts from a place of existing preconceptions. We then transform those preconceptions during later questioning and analysis. This then provides us even more places to start new ideas from. This is called the [[Hermeneutic Circle]] by Hans-Georg Gadamer (Gadamer, 2004)
- ### Let the work carry you forward
	- **A good workflow develops a virtuous cycle**. The positive experience and insight gives motivation to tackle the next task more easily. This cycle can only develop if the work itself becomes rewarding. If it does, the work is propelled forward in a self-sustainable way thanks to ongoing motivation and reward. *Tricking ourselves with external rewards though is only a short-term solution* and doesn't contribute to a positive feedback loop.
		- References
			- Vicious cycle of failure (cf. Fishbach, Eyal, and Finkelstein, 2010)
			- Motivation and reward becoming self-sustainable (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).
			- Michelle Segar uses this dynamic to turn couch potatoes into exercise aficianados (Segar, 2015)
	- **A virtual cycle at its core is a feedback loop**. Feedback loops are comprised of two parts: rapid feedback, and a way to integrate the feedback directly back into the system. So not only do we need to get timely and concrete feedback, we also need a learning system that enables the motivation from the feedback to shape the future work as well. With a solid feedback loop, you better improve your work while you work on it.
		- References
			- Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their positive self-image might feel better in the short-term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance (Dweck, 2006; 2013).
	- Our work can carry itself forward by us recognizing the **many different layers and opportunities for virtual cycles and feedback loops in our structure**. The process of taking notes and integrating them involves several loops-within-loops. These give us even *more opportunities to generate feedback and new connection ideas*.
	- #### Loops all the way down
		- "Reading with a pen in hand" (as Benjamin Franklin refers to it) forces us to **think about what we are reading in a way that we can capture it in writing**. We tend to think we understand what we read, until we go to write it down and communicate it to others. *Writing down the ideas gives us a chance to realize our lack of understanding*. One feedback loop.
		- The **more of these notes we take, the more feedback we get, the better we get at taking notes**. The better we get, the easier and quicker taking notes become. This again increases the number of notes we are generating and integrating, which in turn *gives us more learning experiences to build upon*.
		- **Increased efficiency provides a feedback loop** as well. The more we use this system, the better we get at identifying what information is worth noting down or not. This allows us to filter and absorb information more easily which enables us to read more. *The more we can read, the more we will learn*.
		- Permanent notes provide another feedback loop.. **When we capture our own thoughts in writing, we are presented with any shortcomings to our ideas**. As we look at how to file the new idea into our Zettelkasten, the system will show us contradictions, inconsistencies, and repetitions.
		- **This feedback is also available to us at all times** and doesn't require external feedback from other people. At any time, we can always look through our Zettelkasten and improve a little bit, every single day. The more our Zettelkasten grows, the more useful it becomes to us.

## Six steps to successful writing

- ### Avoid Multitasking
	- **We should stay focused on the single task at hand.** We are inherently bad at multitasking. While we feel more productive while multitasking, studies show multitasking actually results in much lower work quality and quantity. It also reduces our ability to respond to distractions as they occur as our attention is already divided. Unfortunately, increasingly familiarity doesn't mean increased skill, though we often confuse the two.
		- References
			- While those who multitasked *felt* more productive, their productivity actually decreased - by a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009)
			- The mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it - complete independent of our actual performance (Bornstein, 1989).
	- A **Zettelkasten gives us the structure (and just enough structure) that we need to remain focused**. It also encourages us to shift our focus consciously better different types of tasks.
- ### Embrace a Flexible Focus (Give each task the right kind of attention)
	- "Writing... involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting, and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention." - How To Take Smart Notes, 2ed, Ahrens
		- Proofreading requires a critical eye and a dispassionate mindset. You are looking for flaws in arguments, questionable conclusions, contradictions. If we don't get removed far enough from the text, we will still be seeing our own thoughts, not the writing itself.
		- We also don't want the proofreader to get in the way of putting thoughts down on paper. If we insisted on a perfectly crafted sentence without any flaws while doing our initial writing and thinking, we would never end up writing anything down.
		- Outlining or changing the outline is different than other tasks. Outlining requires us focusing on the entire document as a whole and not to get lost in the weeds.
	- "Working with the slip-box means playing with ideas and looking out for interesting connections and comparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clusters, and preparing the order of notes for a project. Here, we need to puzzle over notes and find the best fit. It is much more associative, playful, and creative than the other tasks and requires a different kind of attention as well." 
	- Writing in a focused way also requires **knowing what you do _not_ need to write about**. Always have the outline open to consult with so that you remember what you are covering in other sections.
	- **Both focused attention and floating attention are needed for art and science**. Not just one or the other. So we need to be flexible based on the type of attention that the task we are working on asks for.
		- References
			- "Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands." (Vartanian 2009, 57)
			- "On one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that's important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both ... The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind, and a narrow analytical frame." (Dean, 2013, 152)
- ### Become an expert instead of a planner
	- "... bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise." - Flyvbjerg 2001, 15
	- "The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn." - How to make smart notes, 2ed, Ahrens #quote #learning
		- References
			- "Real experts don't make plans" (Flyvbjerg 2001, 19).
	- **Autonomy is key to becoming an expert**. We need the power to make our own decisions and to be able to make mistakes that we can learn from. "Like reading a bicycle, it can only be done by doing."
		- An experiment was conducted. Beginner and expert paramedics and their teachers were shown videos of either experienced or beginner paramedics giving CPR (Flyvbjerg, 2001).
			- Experienced paramedics correctly identified their own ~90% of time
			- Beginners were more or less guessing (~50% accuracy)
			- Teachers were wrong *in most cases*, confusing beginners for experts and experts for beginners.
	- An expert's **intuition occurs when necessary knowledge has been internalized** over many repeated and varied experiences.
		- References
			- "Their decisions in complex situations are explicitly not made by long rational-analytical considerations, but rather come from the gut (cf. Gigerenzer, 2008a, 2008b).
- ### Get closure
	- **Short-term memory is also limited**, not just our attention. It's long been estimated we can hold about seven things in our hold at a time, plus or minus two (Miller 1956). Memory artists also use techniques to bundle items up into packages of up to seven (Levin and Levin 1990). Though that number could be as low as four (Cowan 2001).
	- Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik discovered what is now known as the Zeigarnik effect: **open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory until they are done**. Zeigarnik later discovered that there's a different way we can get our brains to stop thinking about these things:  to capture them in a way where our brains are convinced it will be taken care of. This is also why Allen's "Getting Things Done" is so successful.

			- Feynman's 12 questions allows us to keep our main questions fresh in our short-term memory to better develop connections with new information we learn.
	- "The secret to have a 'mind like water' is to **get _all_ the little stuff out of our short-term memory**" (How To Take Smart Notes, 2ed, Ahrens).
	- Get closure in two simple steps: first, break down the amorphous task into smaller pieces of different tasks that can all be finished in "one go". Second, always write down the outcome of our thinking, *including possible connections to further questions*. This allows us to pick up any time where we left off, no matter how long it's been.
	- **Thinking in writing prevents us from needing to remember what we need to "keep in mind."** Our short-term memory can be kept fresh since the system itself has any possible subsequent tasks, open questions, project reminders, etc. captured in writing at all times.
- ### Reduce the number of decisions
	- Reducing the number of decisions we make gives us the space to **focus on the decisions that matter and are the most impactful**. Decision-making is known to cost willpower. A surprising number of decisions and tasks lead to this. Adopting the Zettelkasten method allows us to eliminate nearly all organizational decisions since most of the decisions are made for us by the system.

			- "Our results suggest that a a broad assortment of actions make use of the same resource. Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition." (Baumeister et al., 1998, 1263f)
	- "By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced" ("How to Take Smart Notes", 2ed, Ahren)
- ### Read for understanding
	- **Writing down the most salient and captivating ideas while reading forces you to reframe the ideas into your own language and thinking**. Ideas are transformed and start becoming your own from the moment they are written down. (p73)
	- **These notes are shaped and impacted by the thinking already reflected in your Zettelkasten**. The Zettelkasten grows and matures at the same time as your own development. This symbiosis helps to encourage more creative thinking by encouraging us to turn normally isolated or separated facts into interconnected ideas. (p73)
	- **Good writing starts with good note taking**. Writing is the expressing of ideas, the formation of which occur as new information is processed (reading, writing, listening, etc.). Writing good solid notes helps kick-start the process of idea formation. (p73)
	- **The goal of reading is to have a "meaningful dialog" with the text**. It is *not* about copying. Copying can be inaccurate or downright harmful as most of the original context is lost and the words could be interpreted differently when read within a slightly different context (e.g. your own writing). (p75)
	- **Always read with an eye towards connections in your Zettelkasten**. The aim is to *capture the ideas behind what's written on the page*. (p75)
	- **More complex ideas will necessitate more notes**. It shouldn't be surprising when exploring a new subject generates a lot of notes. This is an important part of learning a new subject and discovering what we don't know. (p75)
	- **Quickly recognizing and absorbing new ideas requires a large collection of mental models and thinking frameworks** for efficiency (cf. Rickheit and Sichelschmidt, 1999). (p76)
	- **Literature notes exist to facilitate the writing and generation of new notes**. So what is most helpful towards this goal is to think about the framing, the theoretical background, methodology or perspective of what we read. This often involves reflect as much on what is NOT mentioned. (p76)
	- **Handwriting notes is more effective for understanding**. Researchers compared students who typed notes vs. students who wrote notes. Those writing notes understood the content more, though both groups remembered the same facts. (p78)
	- **Confirmation bias invasively inhibits our ability to think creatively**. When we decide to write on a subject, our brains immediately start seeking out relevant information and confirmation. Our brain also naturally filters out contradictory information around us as if we never saw it in the first place. (p79)
	- **A learning system should have anti-confirmation-bias techniques built into it**. It's the awareness of our own confirmation bias that helps us avoid it. By building this into our system and process, we don't need to use our finite amount of willpower to work against our confirmation bias either. (p79)
	- We can avoid confirmation bias by **focusing on finding any connected information to an idea** *regardless of arguments it supports* and by focusing on our ideas bottom-up. **Bottom-up thinking encourages us to follow interesting turns of events and new ideas and connections** instead of validating our own biases. (p80)
	- The Zettelkasten method **encourages us to focus on new connections** by redirecting our attention from our projects with preconceived ideas *towards the Zettelkasten's connections potential*. (p80)
	- **Disconfirming data carries a lot of potential for generating fresh connections**. Confirmation data, while nice, only reinforces existing connections. (p81)
	- We can **more easily filter information** during reading and writing by **focusing on whether something is connected to existing ideas in any way or stands on its own**. (p80)
	- It's **much easier to write an interesting text when faced with many pros and cons and nuanced thought** compared to a set of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes. (p81)
	- **Conclusions and narratives should come after the exploration of a topic**, not before. We should have a healthy understanding of the pros and cons and different ideas within a topic before we formulate our own conclusions and narratives. (p81)
	- The **ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is a skill that can be learned and practiced**. The focused and deliberate practice is simply distinguishing the kernels of ideas from supporting background details. (p81)
	- **Improving our ability to spot patterns is a virtuous cycle**. We recognize the essence of content faster, which means we can read more, which means we learn even more patterns. *This increases the power and number of our thinking tools to help us learn and understand better*. (p83)
	- **Taking notes trains us to shift our attention towards how ideas are framed, patterns in the content, assumptions being made**, etc. Learn to look beyond into what is not being said, or what could be contradictory. (p83)
	- **Learning to take smart notes and read better helps us increase our ability to be understood**. Then we need to deliberatively practice to continue to improve. (p84)
	- **A vital element of thinking critically is being able to identify framing, assertions, and assumptions being made behind an argument**. This is even more important than knowledge because without it, we can't apply the knowledge we've gained in the first place. (p84)
	- **Taking smart notes is the deliberate practice of developing critical thinking and writing skills**. Reading or writing alone doesn't cut it. (p84)
	- **We need to test ourselves in some way to identify whether we truly know something or not**. Writing is a quick way to do this. When we have to rephrase something in our own words, we quickly find out what we don't understand or not. (p85)
	- **Reading without writing is not an efficient use of time**. Very rarely will we retain the information and, even if we do, we haven't given ourselves the base opportunity to connect it with our other ideas. (p85)
	- **Beware the mere-exposure effect**. Seeing something we've seen before gives us the same feeling as if we recalled it from memory. It's a false impression though. Our brains can tricks us into thinking we're learning. (p85)
	- **Learning takes effort. Making new connections takes energy**. You need to be able to dig up stored ideas to possibly connect with the new idea. (p87)
	- **If we try to answer a question before we know the answer, we will learn the answer better** later even if we got the answer wrong (p88).

- Meetings, meetings, meetings in the morning
	- Squeezed smaller administrative stuff in between meetings (getting machine ready for afternoon burndown, some task map updates, etc.)
- Found some fixes for synthetic-LMS tests that weren't passing locally (my hunch is a breaking change in a recent minor protractor upgrade)
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8450
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8451
- Cleaned up other tests whilst burning them down:
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8452
- DELIVERY IS GO FOR RELEASE (all green)
- Started working on fixes for catalog tests
	- Fix for ted login: https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8455
	- Fix for typeahead tests: https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8458
		- This is a PERFECT example of a test suite that SHOULD be a unit test suite. I'd rather convert these to unit tests long-term, but given the importance of release and burndown stabilization, I just made these into "proper" e2e tests for now. I hope this should enable them to pass in cloud test run as well once they are merged.

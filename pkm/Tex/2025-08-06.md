- Sick days filed and Slack (mostly) caught up on
- Created kick-off board for [[TypeScript Engineering Specialty]]: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIh3k72w=/?moveToWidget=3458764636625287620&cot=14
- Got access to Windows again
	  - Turns out I was _such_ an early adopter that I wasn't actually logged in as my Okta account, it was a local Windows account
	  - Sadly, this means that I needed to rebuild my Windows VM, largely from scratch
- Got machine ready for burndown again (see Windows VM issues above)
- Completed burndown of angular and API tests in Delivery
- Started burndown of behats in Delivery
	- Having issues where every single test is failing and haven't been able to get to bottom of it
	- This is likely a configuration issue on my machine as I'm not sure I've really ran any behats in a long time.
	- Pivoted over to catalog tab as something seems "off" about behats on my machine
- Burned down several failing Catalog tests and did initial burndown of API tests
- Whipped up PR fixes/improvements for several test suites while I was at it this afternoon (just while I was in them burning them down):
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8482
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8483
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8484 (this one is just code comments in a known-to-fail test to help prevent engineers from wasting cycles on these two failing tests during future burndown runs)
	- https://github.com/OpenSesame/Angular/pull/8485

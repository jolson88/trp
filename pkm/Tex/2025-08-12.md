- Fun learning to support the push jobs!
	- Feel much better about kicking them off again, looking at their logs, understanding the configuration for APIs being called (tenant_domain), etc.
- Found mis-configuration of new Degreed customer integration where batch size was using default of 100, but Degreed throttles to 70/minute. So needed to be updated in `tenant_domain` to 68 like other Degreed customer integrations
	- Added possible campsite on-call activities for adding jobId to push service log, and looking into whether default for new Degreed integrations can be set to 68 instead of 100 (may be a Retool update?)
- Added global `xapi-audit` command that runs AP's new support script
- Also added `command` column in daily on-call task list table

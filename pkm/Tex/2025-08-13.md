- Digging into push failures
	- Started research on 403 issue w/ reported customer issue (roped in team to help)
	- Reran failed push jobs that were re-runnable
	- Captured 401 permission issue jobs that need to be investigated more
- Enabled/encouraged Damian to use the morning time to get up on latest mac setup stuff
- Reached out to data-ops on getting ANALYST role access to be able to do xapi completion audit
- Ran through runbooks for all CloudWatch alarm failures
	- Worked through runbooks for all three activated alarms
	- Hopefully it'll just be time for monitoring and replication to catch-up (as some updates needed to be done in Scorm DB)
- Dug up through Slack and various notes to try to find solution to issue Chris is having (that I had before)

## Typescript Agenda

- I will be leading the TypeScript meeting this month. No other leaders currently assigned, but I hope to "promote from within" and driving the TypeScript specialty to be more collaborative/community-driven.
- Resources:
	- Slack: #engineering-specialty-typescript
	- Zoom: https://opensesame.zoom.us/j/98838007520?pwd=Y6ImkSkldDPSns4oa8UiwJjvgoXTRW.1
- Agenda:
	- **Ice breaker (3-5 minutes)** Building our mascot (using emoji/clip art on Miro board to build our mascot together)
	- **Recap**: The purpose of Engineering Specialties.
	- **Priming brainstorming** (2-3 words on what we each hope to get out of the TypeScript specialty)
	- **General approach for TypeScript specialty**: Collaborative and community-driven.
	- Our **plan for this first meeting**:
		- Identify shared goals for the TypeScript specialty
		- Begin brainstorming activities/topics/workflows we want to cover as a group
		- Identify first topic/activity for us to tackle in our next specialty meeting
	- Shared Brainstorming: **Goals and agreements**
		- Affinity Mapping + Voting
		- Drive consensus on 2-3 initial shared goals for specialty
	- Shared Brainstorming: **Activities/Topics we'd love to use specialty time for**
	- **Identify the first 2-3 topics or activities** we'd like to engage on together

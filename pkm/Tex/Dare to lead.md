## Quotes

**On Perfectionism:**
- Perhaps the most damaging myth of all is that perfectionism is about self-improvement and striving for excellence. This is very wrong: perfectionism is really about attempting to win approval. Most perfectionists are raised in environments that praise their exceptional performance – just think of how you were praised in sports or at school. As a result of this praise, perfectionists develop a damaging belief system that follows them into their adult lives: they anchor their whole sense of self in their accomplishments and brilliant execution.
- All of this locks perfectionists into an exhausting behavioral pattern of pleasing people, perfecting efforts, performing for others, and proving themselves. People with a healthy drive for success, on the other hand, are more self-focused. They inspire themselves by asking how they can improve. It’s a stark contrast with perfectionists, who ask ‘what might others think of me?’
- But there is even a darker side to perfectionism, something that goes way beyond the need to please.
- Research shows that perfectionism is associated with addiction, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, perfectionists are more likely to miss opportunities and experience mental paralysis that keeps them from fully engaging. Their fears of being criticized or not meeting the expectations of others keep them from entering the messy arena of life, where healthy competition and striving for true greatness occur.

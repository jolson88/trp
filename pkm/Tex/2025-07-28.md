- **Rolled back test-runner and got new images out for test runs**
	- Created two PRs (Angular and Catalog) and got the rollback done
	- Built the develop and release/0000 images after the changes went in
	- Our new test environments tonight should be configured back to having tests run on web-public
- **Archived old hackweek repo and updated interviews repo for P1 package issues**
	- Grace reached out about these two repos since they were both created by me.
	- I quickly made the changes to interviews for clean `npm audit` runs, and archived old repo
- **Continued researching login issue**
	- Working with Brian and Sara on easy repros or next steps on investigation.
	- I'm hoping to get enough information to at least be able to debug in case tonight's test runs _also_ have issues. Though if that's the case, we will obviously reach out to bring Core folks in for some Real Help :P
	- I learned where some of the new okta-first redirection stuff is handled :). Here's where the redirection patterns are included: https://github.com/OpenSesame/Catalog/blob/19abb15c9e7d1243a3f30467d4791a9432cbff1e/sites/all/modules/os_custom/modules/os_registration/os_registration.module#L102
	- This code is called from the main login flow that determines whether the login redirection needs to happen or not: https://github.com/OpenSesame/Catalog/blob/19abb15c9e7d1243a3f30467d4791a9432cbff1e/sites/all/modules/os_custom/modules/os_registration/os_registration.module#L213
	- The redirection was not happening in my custom test runs because I didn't name them with the right magic pattern for the redirection logic to automatically detect.
	- I've verified last night's test run had the right env variables set so that it was saying redirection _should_ happen. So at least that's been verified. Keeping my fingers crossed (as much as I hope it's not the problem) that the test-runner removal fixes it.
- **Monitoring test runs**
	- Random monitoring of the afternoon/evening test runs
